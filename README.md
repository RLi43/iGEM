## Introduce
In order to achieve portable and simple field allergy detection, we designed and manufactured the hardware testing equipment for this project - a small, inexpensive ($20) system, including a device can measure OD600 and fluorescence intensity, and a small automatic vibration device avoiding the sinking of cells.

The device supports battery or micro USB for power supply. According to the prompts on the display, you can get started quickly; the device will judge your allergies based on the cell concentration and fluorescence intensity after a certain period of reaction.

In addition to the detection applied to this project, this device can also be used in other environments where fast and portable spectrophotometric detection or fluorescence intensity detection is needed.

We refer to the design of Team Aachen, 2014, but our Devices are more automated and miniaturized.

## Trying to make it
Following the reference on wiki, you may confort some problems. Here are some suggestions.
1. Use black material to print 3D parts. At least, paint the inside surface black. Avoiding environment light is imprtant.
2. Take care when you welding or installing parts. They are fragile.
3. Maybe you can delete some unfit design. (e.g. the fragile connection)
